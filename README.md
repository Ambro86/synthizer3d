pip install synthizer3d
```

**Or, to install directly from this repository for development or testing:**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ambro86/synthizer3d
    ```

2. From the project root, run:
    ```sh
    python synthizer-c/vendor.py synthizer-vendored
    ```

3. Install the required libraries to build the project:
    ```sh
