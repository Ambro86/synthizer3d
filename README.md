## ðŸš€ **Audio Format Support**

> **Synthizer3D now supports:**
>
> - **WAV**
> - **MP3**
> - **FLAC**
> - **OGG** Â ðŸ†•
> - **OPUS** ðŸ†•
>
> <br>
>
> **OGG and OPUS support are new!**  
> You can now load, spatialize, and play audio from these formats in your 3D environments.  
> This makes Synthizer3D even more versatile for interactive, gaming, and streaming audio applications.

    ```

4. After that, make sure you have installed additional packages with VCPKG:
    ```sh
    vcpkg install
    ```

5. Make sure that the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable is set correctly, for example for Windows 64bit Writing:
    ```sh
    set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%CD%\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows
    ```

6. Then install with:
    ```sh
